            <p>
                United Entertainment Corp. ("UEC") has created this statement to
                describe its information gathering and privacy practices. We are
                sensitive to the private nature of information you provide to us
                over the Internet. This Privacy Policy is designed to maximize
                your ability to protect your personal information, while at the
                same time permit us to provide you the opportunity to obtain
                interesting and useful information, products and services. At no
                time are you obligated to provide us any personal information,
                and if at any time you no longer wish to receive communications
                from us, you are free to "opt out" of receiving these
                communications. Because this Privacy Policy applies to any
                person who provides information to UEC through its web site, we
                strongly urge you to review this Privacy Policy in its entirety.
                Your use of this web site constitutes acceptance of this Privacy
                Policy and any other applicable terms.
            </p>

            <h4>OUR COLLECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

            <p>
                In order to enable you to register to receive information,
                products or services available through our web site, or to
                permit us to respond to your inquiries, our site's registration
                forms may require that you provide contact information (like
                your name, phone number and e-mail address), demographic
                information (like your ZIP code, age, or income level), and/or
                financial information (like account or credit card numbers), as
                well as your gift card numbers or Loyalty Rewards card number.
                Our online surveys may ask you for contact information,
                demographic information, and lifestyle-related information (like
                your hobbies, favorite athletic teams, buying preferences,
                etc.). We may run contests on our site in which we ask visitors
                for contact information and demographic information. We may also
                collect the Internet Protocol address and e-mail address of
                visitors to our web site, the e-mail addresses of those who post
                messages to a bulletin board, and the e-mail addresses of those
                who communicate with us via e-mail. In addition to this personal
                information, our web servers automatically collect web site
                usage information from you when you visit our web site. Web site
                usage information is anonymous information about our visitors
                that describes how our web site is used and navigated, including
                the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each web
                page, their actions taken during visits to the site, and the
                length of their stays. Web site usage information does not
                contain personally identifiable information.
            </p>

            <h4>OUR USE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

            <p>
                As a general matter we seek to use information collected through
                our web site and Programs to enhance the experience of visitors
                to our site and locations. We (including our affiliates) may use
                this information in a number of ways, including:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    To furnish you with products or services you have requested,
                    or to send you information or otherwise contact you about
                    UEC, or its affiliates, their products, services,
                    advertising, upcoming events, special offers or promotions,
                    or for other purposes disclosed when you submit your
                    information to our web site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To assist us in marketing and advertising our products and
                    services.
                </li>
                <li>To improve the content and navigation on our web site.</li>
                <li>
                    To prevent and detect fraud, infringement, and other
                    potential misuse of our web site.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In order to provide you with products and services you have
                    requested, we may share your information, including
                    personally identifiable information or information we
                    maintain on an aggregate basis, with third parties who
                    provide services to UEC and its affiliates, such as credit
                    card processing, customer services, order fulfillment,
                    and/or prize delivery, as applicable.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                We do not share information with third parties for their direct
                marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such
                disclosure - typically by opting in to receive information from
                a third party that is participating in a sweepstakes or other
                promotion on one of our web sites. If you do not want your
                information to be used by a third party for direct marketing
                purposes (or other purposes unrelated to the uses described
                herein), do not opt in to such use by that third party. Please
                note that if you opt in to receive direct marketing from a third
                party, your information will be subject to that party's privacy
                policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third
                party to use your information, you will need to contact that
                third party directly. We recommend that you review the privacy
                policy of any party that collects your information to determine
                how that entity will handle your information.
            </p>

            <p>
                At any time you may opt-out of receiving marketing
                communications from us or request that we not provide your
                personal contact, demographic, and/or lifestyle-related
                information to third parties. Please see the information below
                regarding opting out.
            </p>

            <h4>CHILDREN'S GUIDELINES</h4>
            <p>
                UEC does not specifically target its online services to children
                under 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13 you may use
                our web site only under the supervision of a parent or guardian.
                Please note that our site may contain links to content providers
                that collect information from children under the age of 13. We
                have no control over such content providers and are not
                responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other
                web sites. Because the Internet offers open access to a wide
                range of information, it is important that parents supervise and
                prevent access to inappropriate content, email or chat sessions.
            </p>

            <h4>COOKIES</h4>

            <p>
                Our site uses cookies to keep track of your favorite locations.
                We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to
                save your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time
                you visit our site, and for other purposes. Cookies are lines of
                text that are transmitted to your Web browser when you click on
                a site. They provide a way for a server to recall a previous
                request or previous registration so that information does not
                have to be reinserted. Your browser stores the information on
                your hard drive and when you return to that site later, the
                cookie is transmitted back only to the servers that originally
                sent it to you. A cookie does not collect or keep your name or
                other personally identifying information; however, we may link
                the information obtained through cookies to other personally
                identifiable information to give us a better understanding of
                your preferences, so that we can provide a more meaningful
                experience to you on our web site. To be notified when you are
                about to receive a cookie, you can configure your browser to
                alert you when a site is attempting to send you a cookie and at
                that time you will have the option of refusing the cookie.
                Consult your browser's "Help" function for more information.
                Advertisers that serve ads on our web site may also use their
                own cookies. These cookies collect their own information
                independent of UEC's activities. You can disable this cookie
                capability as described above. We use an independent ad company
                to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies.
                Cookies received with banner ads are collected by the ad
                company, and although we do not have access to this information,
                some customer data may be shared with the advertisers.
            </p>

            <h4>THIRD-PARTY SITES</h4>

            <p>
                This site contains links to other web sites that we believe you
                might find useful and informative. Please be aware, however,
                that UEC does not endorse or recommend these sites' content or
                services, and UEC is not responsible for the privacy practices
                or the content of these other sites. We encourage you to review
                the privacy policies of each site you visit. Remember, the
                statements in this Privacy Policy apply solely to information
                collected by UEC.
            </p>

            <h4>BEACONING</h4>

            <p>
                If you use NCM's Movie Night Out or other approved mobile
                application on a mobile device and your settings allow it, we
                may collect information about your location within participating
                theatres and retail locations through your mobile device's
                Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or similar capabilities&nbsp;based on the
                detection of signals from nearby proximity beacons and Wi-Fi
                networks.&nbsp;We will only gather these kinds of location
                information if you agree to share them with us by opting-in
                within the Movie Night Out or other approved mobile application
                (either during your initial login or later) and by enabling
                these capabilities on your mobile device.&nbsp;Once you have
                opted-in to receive offers and information and consented to our
                use of location information, the Movie Night Out or other
                approved mobile application will continue to collect location
                information (even if it is running in the background) until you
                opt-out, log-off or use your phone's or other device's setting
                to disable your mobile device's applicable geolocation, GPS,
                Bluetooth or similar capabilities for the
                application.&nbsp;Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section
                below for more information on how to limit the location
                information that we may collect from your mobile device.
            </p>

            <h4>SECURITY</h4>

            <p>
                The personally identifiable information we collect about you is
                stored in limited access servers, accessible only by employees
                or agents of UEC. We will maintain appropriate safeguards,
                including technical measures, warnings, and firewalls, to
                protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of any customer
                information under our control.
            </p>

            <h4>
                CHOICE AND OPT-OUT: TO REMOVE YOUR NAME AND INFORMATION FROM OUR
                LISTS
            </h4>

            <p>
                You have the choice to opt-out of receiving marketing
                communications from us, and to limit our disclosure of your
                information to other companies. However, in order to participate
                in the Loyalty Rewards Program we need to be able to contact
                you.&nbsp; Continuing to participate in the Loyalty Rewards
                Program constitutes your acceptance to communication related to
                the Program. You can also change or modify information
                previously provided. You may opt out by e-mailing our customer

                If you access any of our Sites through a mobile device, you may
                adjust the settings on your mobile device to allow or prevent
                the sharing of location information. For example, you can
                disable “Location” (or “Location Services” on iOS-based devices)
                on your mobile device to prevent sharing your location
                information with NCM and UEC, or only disable “Bluetooth” to
                prevent the sharing of information collected via nearby
                Bluetooth proximity beacons. Please note that if you disable the
                sharing of location information, you may be unable to access
                some features of our Sites that are designed for mobile devices.
