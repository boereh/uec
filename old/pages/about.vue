      <h2>Company</h2>

      <div class="text-black/70 dark:text-white/70">
        <p>United Entertainment Corp. owns and operates a chain of movie theatres throughout the United States.</p>

        <p>The Company mission is to provide high quality entertainment at reasonable prices to the markets it serves.</p>

        <p>United Entertainment takes pride in bringing the magic of movies and new jobs to communities.</p>

        <p>
          UEC Theatres is a Top 30 theatre circuit in the United States with 191 screens at 22 complexes. With operations in 13 states currently, from east
          coast to west coast, UEC remains poised for growth.
        </p>

        <p>
          Founded in 1991, privately held United Entertainment Corp. started exclusively as a video store chain and grew to 25 video stores at its peak.
          Meanwhile, the decision was made to diversify into the theatre business. The first UEC theatre was built in 1997 and the theatre side of the business
          has grown steadily since.
        </p>

        <p>
          We acquire, develop and operate multi-screen cinemas in small and midsized markets throughout the United States. While UEC owns nearly all its land
          and buildings, we are open to the possibility of leasing too. If you are interested in selling your theatre or theatres, are developing a new theatre
          for lease or have land in a city that needs a theatre, please check out UEC's Development page for information.

          Most people will agree that movies and snacks go hand in hand. UEC Theatres understands that high quality food and drink items are an integral part of
          the movie-going experience. When you walk into a UEC Theatre, be prepared to overwhelm your senses with the distinct smell of fresh popped theatre
          popcorn.
        </p>

        <p>
          UEC Theatres carries many of the most iconic and well-known concession brands including Coca-Cola fountain soft drinks and frozen beverages and candy.
          Many locations have expanded food menu options which may include hot dogs, hamburgers, pretzel bites, nachos and pizza. Cooked in a restaurant quality
          Turbo Chef oven for speed and freshness, you will be surprised by how good the food is.
        </p>

        <p>We are continually adding a wider selection of food to our theatres so please stop back.</p>
